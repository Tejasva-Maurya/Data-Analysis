# InternSavy_DataAnalysis

## Description: 
The InternSavy_DataAnalysis project is a comprehensive exploration into the world of data science through three distinct Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook is dedicated to a unique aspect of data analysis, providing insights and predictive models that can be leveraged for academic and commercial purposes.

## Subprojects:

### Task_1.ipynb (Admission Predict Analysis): 
Utilizes the Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv dataset to predict university admission probabilities based on student performance metrics. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of regression models to forecast outcomes.

### Task_2.ipynb (Mall Customer Segmentation): 
Analyzes the Mall_Customers.csv dataset to segment customers based on their shopping behavior and demographics. This subproject employs clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups, aiding in targeted marketing efforts.

### Task_3.ipynb (Sales Data Analysis): 
Focuses on extracting actionable insights from sales data to drive business decisions. The notebook presents a thorough analysis of sales trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used:

- Python for programming.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and sharing of live code.
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
